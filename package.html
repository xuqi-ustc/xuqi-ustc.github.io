  <p style="text-align: left;"><font size="5"> <strong> Combining Ant System Algorithm and Simulated Annealing for 3D/2D Fixed-Outline Floorplanning</strong>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><font size="3"> We proposed a two-phase algorithm for 3D/2D Fixed-Outline Floorplanning with minmization of wirelength and through silicon vias. The AS algorithm is used to globally generate solutions in the first phase, which are then improved by the SA-based searching algorithm in the second phase. During AS phase, a probability layer assignment strategy is proposed to determine the layer assignment of blocks. Compared with some previous fixed-outline floorplanners, two-phase algorithm is very effective.

  <p style="text-align: left;"><font size="3"> Given the replaceable relations between functional TSVs and between functional TSVs and spare TSVs, we propose a method to firstly determine the maximum number of tolerated faults in polynomial time. Then, an integer linear programming (ILP) based model and an efficient min-cost-max-flow (MCMF) based heuristic method are proposed to generate fault-tolerance structures with minimization of the multiplexer delay overhead and the hardware cost.
